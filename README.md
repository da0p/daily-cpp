# Daily C++

A daily piece of C++ code. 

I create this repository solely for myself on the journey of improving and 
updating my C++ knowledge. I experimented with different source code from 
different books. Some experiments just comes from my exploration.

Mainly from the following books
- Concurrency with Modern C++ 
- Template Metaprogramming with C++
- Functional Programming in C++
- C++ Lambda story
